**Unofficial FourSquare glassware**

This project is in a very early stage - I started it at hackathon in Prague using Mirror API, but now I'm rewriting it using GDK.

== What it can do ==
- adds voice command 'Nearby venues'
- then it displayes nearest venue according to Foursquare recommendation engine

== Plans ==
Big :)

== How to build it ==
Import it into Android Studio via Gradle.
